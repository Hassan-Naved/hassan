        <h2>SIMPLE CAR</h2>
        <h3>Simple cars are often characterized by their straightforward design, minimalistic features, and focus on
            practicality. These vehicles typically prioritize functionality over luxury, making them ideal for
            individuals seeking reliable transportation without the frills. Basic models usually come with essential
            features such as manual transmission, basic audio systems, and limited electronic components, which not only
            reduce the overall cost but also make them easier to maintain. Simple cars are often appreciated for their
            fuel efficiency and lower environmental impact, as they tend to be lighter and have smaller engines compared
            to more complex vehicles. Additionally, their simplicity can translate into a more connected driving
            experience, allowing drivers to feel more in control and engaged with the road.</h3>

        <h2>DRIFTING CAR</h2>

        <h3>Drifting is a driving technique and motorsport where the driver intentionally oversteers, causing a loss of traction in the rear wheels while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner. This is achieved by counter-steering and precise throttle control, allowing the car to glide sideways at high speeds. Originating in Japan in the 1970s and popularized by figures like Keiichi Tsuchiya, also known as the "Drift King," drifting has since become a global phenomenon. Drifting events are often held on closed circuits where drivers compete based on their speed, angle, and overall style. The sport emphasizes both the skill of the driver and the performance of the car, often requiring modifications to enhance handling and power. The aesthetic appeal and the adrenaline rush of sliding through turns have made drifting a beloved motorsport, celebrated in various media including films, video games, and international competitions like the Formula Drift series.</h3>
